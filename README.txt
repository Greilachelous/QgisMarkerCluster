QgisMarkerCluster
-----------------
The plugin takes point layers and creates clusters by distance similar to openlayer or leaflet cluster plugins.

Usage
-----
- load a point layer dataset (an example dataset can be added with the button)
- setup the first cluster
- the algorithm saves the results as a temporal shape file, so you can add as much layers as u want
- define your preferred distance
- the standard style is a simple circle labeled with the count of points inside the cluster
    
Upcomming features
------------------
- define addidional columns to be available as label (e.x. mean, max or min values of the input column)
- set different styles per scale
